               <span>  (Accepted & Published)	in IEEE conference proceedings</span><br><br>
               <p>This paper suggests a method for adding Internet of Things (IoT) devices to shopping carts in order to improve customer satisfaction, increase sales, and ultimately increase store profits. Usually the busiest area of the store is the billing counter, which gets especially busier around the holidays. People become impatient while standing in lengthy lines for an extended period of time as a result. They might even decide not to visit crowded stores, which causes the businesses to suffer a significant loss. Our suggested method increases accessibility to the charging process in order to solve this issue. Customers may view the products, their number, and the total amount due with more ease. The shopping cart or trolley will have multiple sensors and a tiny canister that houses the NodeMCU.<br></p>

               <span>  (Accepted & Published)	in IEEE conference proceedings</span><br><br>
               <p>Permissioned blockchain networks ensure safety and reliability by employing blockchain’s fundamental tenets, including the distributed ledger, smart contracts, and consensus. There is a potential for data privacy violations in the existing condition of patient data interchange across healthcare organizations if there is a lack of mutual trust. The introduction of blockchain technology has made it possible for healthcare providers to confidently share patient medical records. To ensure the safe and reliable transfer of patient information, a permission blockchain network built on the Hyperledger Fabric framework is proposed and implemented between patents and medical institutions. Blockchain’s effective management of EHRs is made possible by a Hyper Ledger Fabric network. Results from live deployments demonstrate that inaccuracies in data sharing between healthcare providers (such as hospitals, clinics, and public health agencies) are eliminated by using a blockchain based on the Hyperledger fabric. The accessibility of the network allows for the prompt, secure, and legally compliant transfer of patient information across organizations. By using smart contracts as chain code, the blockchain has enabled transparent and secure data exchanges while controlling access to private patient health information. Results indicate Hyper Ledger Fabric provides excellent functionality, security, and transaction privacy.

               <p>
                 In the modern educational landscape, digital transformation is
                 imperative, even for college departments. To enhance efficiency
                 and streamline operations, a comprehensive management system is
                 proposed. Many of the tasks carried in departments are manual and
                 require loads of paperwork and bureaucratic process. This
                 warrants unnecessary time and with rapid digitization, it must be
                 brought within the digital umbrella. This research survey paper
                 conducts a thorough exploration and analysis of &quot;REConnect,&quot; an
                 effective College Department Management System (CDMS)
                 designed to streamline communication, collaboration, and
                 administrative processes within academic departments, with a keen
                 eye on functionalities and potential benefits. This paper offers a
                 comprehensive overview of how this system can automate
                 departmental management within college.

                 <span> Accepted and Presented in IEEE Conference Proceedings</span><br><br>
                 <p>
                 Suicide is a persisting issue that plagues the modern world to this very day. Factors such as rapid technological advancements and the COVID-19 pandemic have significantly reduced human connection, exacerbating feelings of loneliness and despair, ultimately leading to suicide and depression. Numerous factors contribute to the identification of suicides. This paper proposes an attention mechanism-based transformer model, leveraging data obtained from the Reddit platform for the prediction and classification of suicidal text detection using its efficient context processing. We base our approach on weights and refine natural language processing and data processing techniques to send only the crucial context to the model, thereby enhancing its reliability and accuracy compared to traditional machine learning models such as regression, random forest, and neural networks. On test data, the work achieved accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 scores of 0.97, 0.95, 0.93, and 0.96, respectively. The work is also extrapolated to a Generative AI solution with intelligent chatbot capabilities that can provide timely comforting care for people with suicide risk, thereby saving lives.

The design also features a discreet camera for real-time object recognition, and speakers or haptic feedback mechanisms to convey navigational cues. The walking stick is powered by an AI module housed within a compact, waterproof casing that processes sensory data and provides auditory or tactile feedback to the user. This integration of advanced technology within an aesthetically pleasing and functional design ensures the smart walking stick offers both practicality and style, significantly enhancing the mobility and independence of visually impaired users.

              <span>   (Work in Progress)	</span><br><br>
              <p>
                Generative AI applications are the biggest enablers of Large Language Models and the most widely used consumer product in terms of Machine Learning or Data Analytics. These applications provide solutions across verticals by processing huge volumes of data. The real-time data is not safe from bias and chatbots are vulnerable to hallucinations. Standardized mechanisms are not in place for many Generative AI applications and most of the existing research focusses solely on processing training datasets to counter hallucination and bias. The article elucidates various approaches currently in place along with their advantages and limitations. The objective of this article is to devise a workflow that takes care that the content generated are free from misinterpretations and efficient methodology has been adopted in various stages. The proposed approach ensures that a dedicated hybrid pipeline for mitigating bias and hallucinations at every stage of the query processing from prompt input to the output of content. The mentioned approach includes preprocessing techniques, identification techniques, model response processing, generation, feedback mechanism along with dataset processing, manipulations, interactions and performance metrics. The article considers the gender-spending trends analysis dataset for study. The paper also deliberates on the ethical considerations and responsibilities that vest upon the AI chatbots and the framework proposed.
